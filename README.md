The Most simple face recognition program
========================================
----------------------------------------

This is probably the most simple face recognition program,it includes like 80 lines of code in total.
This project is based on the [face_recognition library](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) which is also the simplest face recognition library.

Installation
============

Download and insall [python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/). This library is easier to install on 3.6, the newer versions require
a bunch of dependencies and many installation procudures especially for the dlib library. So it's better off installing python 3.6. If any other version of python is installed it's allright 
just install this too and select the 3.6 version while running this program.

After installing python 3.6, open cmd (as administrator) and run this command


pip install opencv


pip install face-recognition


It installs all the dependencies which takes some time so be patient.


and that's it!! as simple as that.


Working
========

Download the complete folder and unzip

Create a folder named 'faces' inside the 'face recognition' folder

copy the pics of people whose faces you want to recognize
into the 'faces' folder and rename the photos with their names.(only jpg format).

run the 'trainscrypt.py' first

and then run the 'main.py' it should bring up a camera window and recognize the faces.

voila!!!
